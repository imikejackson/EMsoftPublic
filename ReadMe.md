# EMsoft Version 3.1 #

This package contains a series of programs along with a library, mostly written in fortran-90 with some OpenCL bits, for the computation and visualization of scanning electron microscopy diffraction patterns, notably EBSD, ECP, and EKP. The programs can be used as standalone command-line programs, and produce HDF5 output files that can then be visualized using an IDL virtual app (Interactive Data Language) or read and processed from any other package with HDF5 capability.

This is the first release of version 3.1; next release, 3.2, is planned for late 2017.

## Financial Support ##
Current EBSD/ECP/EKP development of this package, including dictionary indexing for EBSD/ECP, is supported by an AFOSR/MURI grant, FA9550-12-1-0458; the original EBSD code from CTEMsoft 2.0 was developed with support from an ONR grant, N00014-12-1-0075.  More recent development of other related modalities, including the creation of routines that can generate PoVRay visualization script files, was performed with support from an ONR Vannevar Bush Fellowship, N00014-­16-­1-­2821.

## Source ##
Source codes are here on GitHub. Some precompiled OS X binaries, manuals, and IDL Virtual Machine apps, as well as additional information about the package may be made available at [Here](http://muri.materials.cmu.edu/?p=858).
